  <h3>Self employed Freelancer</h3>
  <h4>The Story</h4>
  <p>
    I started freelancing in 1998 during my study course in communication
    science at LMU Munich. Being quite successful in freelancing and frustrated
    with the formalities of my university I teamed up with a partner and we
    founded Liquidlounge in the year 2000, an organisation dedicated to deliver
    rich multimedia content to the web.
  </p>
  <p>
    Once Liquidlounge was born I decided to start a professional freelance
    career, resulting in never graduating in my university. Very early I focused
    on the Flash platform and became a specialist in the language ActionScript.
    With ActionScript evolving I started to learn and use more complex coding
    patterns like composition and inheritance also structuring my code into MVC
    patterns.
  </p>
  <p>
    As the demand for CMS powered websites emergerged, I also specialized on
    delivering rich TYPO3 powered websites. I used jQuery to add the missing
    interactivity. But Flash was still heavily requested in countless online
    marketing campaigns. I was mostly contracted, whenever my clients could not
    complete a task with the animation timeline and code was needed.
  </p>
  <p>
    In the end, one of my clients (Redblue Marketing GmbH) offered me a
    permanent employment to help establish their new born digital unit.
